# Decision-Tree-Implementation
This is Decision Tree classifier built from scratch in Python using only NumPy. It demonstrates core concepts like Entropy and Information Gain to find the best splits. The model recursively builds the tree, respecting `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`.The notebook trains and tests the classifier on breast cancer dataset, achieving 93% accuracy.
